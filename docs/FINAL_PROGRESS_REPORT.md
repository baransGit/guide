## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Major Problem: Data Accuracy**

#### **Real User Feedback from Chat:**

```
🗣️ User: "73 warren road marrickville bu adresi kullanarak bak"
🎭 System: "Meeks Road durağına ~2 dakika yürüyüş"
🗣️ User: "yalniz bir sorun var 73 warren road meeks duragina uzak
          warren road uzerinde basla duraklar olmalii"
```

**📋 Issues Document Created:** `docs/ISSUES_TO_FIX.md`

### **Technical Problems Discovered:**

1. **🚌 Transport Data Completely Mock**

   - NSW Transport API not actually called
   - Bus stop locations incorrect
   - Fake real-time schedules

2. **🍜 Restaurant Data Questionable**

   - Google Places API mock mode
   - Restaurant details may be fabricated
   - Distance calculations estimated

3. **🔌 WebSocket Instability**

   - Random connection drops
   - No reconnection logic
   - Tool availability issues

4. **🧠 Intent Detection Gaps**
   - Tool recommendations often empty
   - Context loss between messages
   - Poor tool selection logic
